            <strong>The HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or<br> 
            first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields. A paragraph is a group of words put <br>
            together to form a group that is usually longer than a sentence.Paragraphs are often made up of several sentences.There are usually between three and eight sentences.<br>
            Paragraphs
            can begin with an indentation (about five spaces), or by missing a line out, and then starting again. This makes it easier to see when one paragraph ends and another begins. 
            In most organized forms of writing, such as essays, paragraphs contain a topic sentence .
            This topic sentence of the paragraph tells the reader what the paragraph will be about. Essays usually have multiple paragraphs that  make claims to support a thesis statement, which is the central idea of the essay. A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular 
            point or idea. <br> A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.                                     <br>
